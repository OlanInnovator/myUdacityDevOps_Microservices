Apply a configuration to a resource by file name or stdin. The resource name must be specified. This resource will be
created if it doesn't exist yet. To use 'apply', always create the resource initially with either 'apply' or 'create
--save-config'.

 JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

 Alpha Disclaimer: the --prune functionality is not yet complete. Do not use unless you are aware of what the current
state is. See https://issues.k8s.io/34274.

Examples:
  # Apply the configuration in pod.json to a pod
  kubectl apply -f ./pod.json
  
  # Apply resources from a directory containing kustomization.yaml - e.g. dir/kustomization.yaml
  kubectl apply -k dir/
  
  # Apply the JSON passed into stdin to a pod
  cat pod.json | kubectl apply -f -
  
  # Apply the configuration from all files that end with '.json'
  kubectl apply -f '*.json'
  
  # Note: --prune is still in Alpha
  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml that matches label app=nginx and delete all other resources that are not in
the file and match label app=nginx
  kubectl apply --prune -f manifest.yaml -l app=nginx
  
  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml and delete all the other config maps that are not in the file
  kubectl apply --prune -f manifest.yaml --all --prune-allowlist=core/v1/ConfigMap

Available Commands:
  edit-last-applied   Edit latest last-applied-configuration annotations of a resource/object
  set-last-applied    Set the last-applied-configuration annotation on a live object to match the contents of a file
  view-last-applied   View the latest last-applied-configuration annotations of a resource/object

Options:
    --all=false:
        Select all resources in the namespace of the specified resource types.

    --allow-missing-template-keys=true:
        If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to
        golang and jsonpath output formats.

    --cascade='background':
        Must be "background", "orphan", or "foreground". Selects the deletion cascading strategy for the dependents
        (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController). Defaults to background.

    --dry-run='none':
        Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without
        sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.

    --field-manager='kubectl-client-side-apply':
        Name of the manager used to track field ownership.

    -f, --filename=[]:
        The files that contain the configurations to apply.

    --force=false:
        If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of
        some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.

    --force-conflicts=false:
        If true, server-side apply will force the changes against conflicts.

    --grace-period=-1:
        Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for
        immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion).

    -k, --kustomize='':
        Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.

    --openapi-patch=true:
        If true, use openapi to calculate diff when the openapi presents and the resource can be found in the openapi
        spec. Otherwise, fall back to use baked-in types.

    -o, --output='':
        Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath,
        jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).

    --overwrite=true:
        Automatically resolve conflicts between the modified and live configuration by using values from the modified
        configuration

    --prune=false:
        Automatically delete resource objects, that do not appear in the configs and are created by either apply or
        create --save-config. Should be used with either -l or --all.

    --prune-allowlist=[]:
        Overwrite the default allowlist with <group/version/kind> for --prune

    -R, --recursive=false:
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests
        organized within the same directory.

    -l, --selector='':
        Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2). Matching
        objects must satisfy all of the specified label constraints.

    --server-side=false:
        If true, apply runs in the server instead of the client.

    --show-managed-fields=false:
        If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.

    --template='':
        Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format
        is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].

    --timeout=0s:
        The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the
        object

    --validate='strict':
        Must be one of: strict (or true), warn, ignore (or false).              "true" or "strict" will use a schema to validate
        the input and fail the request if invalid. It will perform server side validation if ServerSideFieldValidation
        is enabled on the api-server, but will fall back to less reliable client-side validation if not.                "warn" will
        warn about unknown or duplicate fields without blocking the request if server-side field validation is enabled
        on the API server, and behave as "ignore" otherwise.            "false" or "ignore" will not perform any schema
        validation, silently dropping any unknown or duplicate fields.

    --wait=false:
        If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers.

Usage:
  kubectl apply (-f FILENAME | -k DIRECTORY) [options]

Use "kubectl apply <command> --help" for more information about a given command.
Use "kubectl options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
